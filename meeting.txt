2020.01.08 First meeting for project topic
- Brainstormed project topics:
  (a) Web crawler + data aggregator
  (b) Online personal workspace
  (c) Resume generator/ formatter
  (d) Photo editor
  (e) Movie recommender
  (f) File manager
  
- Eliminated (a) due to complexity and difficulty envisioning front end requirements.

- Eliminated (d) due to lack of web component.

- Desirable project topic characteristics:
  (1) Interesting!
  (2) Modular, allows for functionality to be incrementally implemented.
  (3) Manageable complexity for project timeline.
  
- Last suggested topic: Visual database management service (target customers: those who want to gather and examine survey data).
  -- 2 ways to move data to our server:
     (1) Allow upload of select file formats (.db, .csv, .tsv, etc.).
     (2) Direct input through web survey front end.
  -- Database manipulation using SQL (multi-db merging, filtering, searching, etc.).
  -- Serverside file management/ permission control for sharing.
